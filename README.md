## What is UserApplePie v2.0.0?

Simple User Management System Based on MVC Framework. It's designed to be lightweight and modular, allowing developers to build better and easy to maintain code with PHP.

The base framework comes with a range of [helper classes](https://github.com/simple-mvc-framework/framework/tree/master/app/Helpers).

## Documentation

(Coming Soon!)Full docs & tutorials are available at [www.userapplepie.com](http://www.userapplepie.com).

## Requirements

The framework requirements are limited:

- [Apache Web Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) or equivalent with [mod_rewrite](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html) support
- [PHP 5.5 or greater](http://php.net/downloads.php) is required
- [MySQL database](http://www.mysql.com/). The framework can be changed to work with another database type.

## Installation

(Update Coming Soon)
1. [Download](http://www.userapplepie.com/Downloads/) the framework.
2. Unzip the package.
3. Open `app/Core/Config.php` and set your base path (if the framework is installed in a folder, the base path should reflect the folder path `/path/to/folder/` otherwise a single `/` will do) and database credentials (if a database is needed). Set the default theme. When you are done, rename the file to `Core/Config.php`.
4. Edit `.htaccess` file and save the base path (if the framework is installed in a folder, the base path should reflect the folder path `/path/to/folder/` otherwise a single `/` will do).
